I recommend using either CSRT, KCF, or MOSSE for most object tracking applications:
 * Use CSRT when you need higher object tracking accuracy and can tolerate slower FPS throughput
 * Use KCF when you need faster FPS throughput but can handle slightly lower object tracking accuracy
 * Use MOSSE when you need pure speed
